A simple plugin that tracks the remaining EXP left on your Crafter and Gatherer's Grace buffs.

Please not that this plugin simply attempts to give *a rough estimate*. The exact EXP remaining on the buff is not accessible, so all the plugin can do is estimate based off of EXP gains whilst crafting or gathering. Thus, the display value is only properly estimated when a fresh, unused Grace buff is active upload loading the plugin for the first time (or after an update).

For any questions or bugs, please [Create an Issue](https://github.com/mashirochan/FFXIV-GraceGawker/issues/new/choose).
